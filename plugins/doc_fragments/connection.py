          - URL to the Vault service.
          - If not specified by any other means, the value of the C(VAULT_ADDR) environment variable will be used.
          - If C(VAULT_ADDR) is also not defined then an error will be raised.

      proxies:
        description:
          - URL(s) to the proxies used to access the Vault service.
          - It can be a string or a dict.
          - If it's a dict, provide the scheme (eg. C(http) or C(https)) as the key, and the URL as the value.
          - If it's a string, provide a single URL that will be used as the proxy for both C(http) and C(https) schemes.
          - A string that can be interpreted as a dictionary will be converted to one (see examples).
          - You can specify a different proxy for HTTP and HTTPS resources.
          - If not specified, L(environment variables from the Requests library,https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/user/advanced/#proxies) are used.

          - Path to certificate to use for authentication.

      validate_certs:
        description:
          - Controls verification and validation of SSL certificates, mostly you only want to turn off with self signed ones.
          - Will be populated with the inverse of C(VAULT_SKIP_VERIFY) if that is set and I(validate_certs) is not explicitly provided.
          - Will default to C(true) if neither I(validate_certs) or C(VAULT_SKIP_VERIFY) are set.

      namespace:
        description:
          - Vault namespace where secrets reside. This option requires HVAC 0.7.0+ and Vault 0.11+.
          - Optionally, this may be achieved by prefixing the authentication mount point and/or secret path with the namespace
            (e.g C(mynamespace/secret/mysecret)).
          - If environment variable C(VAULT_NAMESPACE) is set, its value will be used last among all ways to specify I(namespace).

      timeout:
        description:
          - Sets the connection timeout in seconds.
          - If not set, then the C(hvac) library's default is used.

            the L(Retry class in the urllib3 library,https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/urllib3.util.html#urllib3.util.Retry)."
          - This collection defines recommended defaults for retrying connections to Vault.
          - This option can be specified as a positive number (integer) or dictionary.
          - If this option is not specified or the number is C(0), then retries are disabled.
          - A number sets the total number of retries, and uses collection defaults for the other settings.
          - A dictionary value is used directly to initialize the C(Retry) class, so it can be used to fully customize retries.
          - For detailed information on retries, see the collection User Guide.
        type: raw
        version_added: 1.3.0
      retry_action:
        description:

          - This has no effect if a request is not retried.
