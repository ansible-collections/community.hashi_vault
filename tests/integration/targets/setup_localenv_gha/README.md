# `setup_localenv_gha`
A special case "localenv" role that isn't for end-user use, but rather specifically for use in the collection's GitHub Actions CI.

It uses `setup_localenv_docker` but with pre-generated PKI and directly uses the `docker-compose` CLI in CI, in order to avoid additional dependencies and cut down execution time.
