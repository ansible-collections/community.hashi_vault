# NOTE: 'package' does not work properly with Ubuntu/Debian (like the 'default' docker image),
#       if you're running in a version of Python other than the "system" Python, due to system libraries
#       needed for the python 'apt' package. See https://stackoverflow.com/q/13708180/3905079
#       So for those OSes, we'll set the Python interpreter to the symlink in /usr/bin which should
#       always be the correct one that corresponds to the system libraries.
#
#       All this just for unzip, which is only needed to unzip the vault binary to set up for testing.
#       TODO: revisit how we set up vault in the first place or how we host the binary (.gz?)
