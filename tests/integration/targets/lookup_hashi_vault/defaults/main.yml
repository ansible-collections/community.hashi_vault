# the purpose of these policies is to catch when the plugin accepts mount_point but does not pass
# it into hvac. we set the test policy to deny access to this secret and the alt policy to read it
# the test-policy is assigned to the default mount of the auth method, while the alt policy is
# assigned to the alternate (non-default) mount
