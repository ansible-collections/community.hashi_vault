  # this job builds for the PR comparison and publish, so use the most lenient options
  # to give the best possibility of producing a publishable build; the strict build will
  # still result in a failure for the PR as a whole, but for review a partial docsite is
  # better than none.
  # This uses the committed sphinx-init output which already has the lenient options.
