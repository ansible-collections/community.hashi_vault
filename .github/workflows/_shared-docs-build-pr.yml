          A template used to render each line of the file list as markdown. This will be processed as a JavaScript regex replace string,
          and the following named capture groups can be referenced:
          - $<status> -- the single character "status" letter in the file list, like "A" or an added file or "M" for a modified file.
          - $<path_stub> -- the part of the path that will be discarded in the "trimmed" file list.
          - $<path_tail> -- the relative part of the path; this can be used to concatenate to a URL to create links to the published site.
