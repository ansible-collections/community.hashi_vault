removed_features:
  - The minimum supported version of ``ansible-core`` is now ``2.14``, support for ``2.13`` has been dropped (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hashi_vault/pull/403).

trivial:
  - The ``docker-image-versions`` action in the collection has been updated to support Docker Hub images that are not in the default namespace. The ``image`` input is now required and no longer defaults to ``vault`` which is no longer the current location of Vault images (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hashi_vault/pull/403).

breaking_changes:
  - The minimum required version of ``hvac`` is now ``1.2.1`` (https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/collections/community/hashi_vault/docsite/user_guide.html#hvac-version-specifics).
