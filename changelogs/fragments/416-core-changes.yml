major_changes:
  - requirements - the ``requests`` package which is required by ``hvac`` now has a more restrictive range for this collection in certain use cases due to breaking security changes in ``ansible-core`` that were backported (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hashi_vault/pull/416).

trivial:
  - We previously sometimes used options, especially in plugins, as a sort of internal information store for things that needed to be passed between methods, or we overwrote some options internally with values that did not match their documentation-defined type. A breaking change in core that validates and converts types to match config manager definitions has broken this usage. Code has been updated to avoid that, and/or change documented types (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hashi_vault/pull/416).
  - The docker SDK version used in localenv setup has been properly constrained (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hashi_vault/pull/416/commits/905ac5da0778ddc236e346dd55578837a546090e).
