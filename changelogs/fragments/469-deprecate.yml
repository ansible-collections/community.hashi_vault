deprecated_features:
  - ansible-core - support for several ``ansible-core`` versions will be dropped in ``v7.0.0``. The collection will focus on current supported versions of ``ansible-core`` going forward and more agressively drop end-of-life or soon-to-be EOL versions (https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/reference_appendices/release_and_maintenance.html).
  - python - support for several ``python`` versions will be dropped in ``v7.0.0``. The collection will focus on ``python`` versions that are supported by the active versions of ``ansible-core`` on the controller side at a minimum, and some subset of target versions (https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/reference_appendices/release_and_maintenance.html).
