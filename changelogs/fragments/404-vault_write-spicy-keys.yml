bugfixes:
  - vault_write - the ``vault_write`` lookup and module were not able to write data containing keys named ``path`` or ``wrap_ttl`` due to a bug in the ``hvac`` library. These plugins have now been updated to take advantage of fixes in ``hvac>=1.2`` to address this (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hashi_vault/issues/389).
