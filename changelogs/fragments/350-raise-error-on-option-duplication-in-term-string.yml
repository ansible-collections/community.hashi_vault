bugfixes:
  - hashi_vault lookup - a term string with duplicate options would silently use the last value. The lookup now shows a warning on option duplication (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hashi_vault/issues/349).

deprecated_features:
  - hashi_vault lookup - in ``v5.0.0`` duplicate term string options will raise an exception instead of showing a warning (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hashi_vault/issues/356).
