deprecated_features:
  - aws_iam_login auth method - the ``aws_iam_login`` method has been renamed to ``aws_iam``. The old name will be removed in collection version ``3.0.0``. Until then both names will work, and a warning will be displayed when using the old name (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hashi_vault/pull/193).
